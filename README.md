## Hello There ðŸ˜¸, my name is AndrÃ© Silva Moreira
### A.K.A. AndrÃ© SilMor / Drowearl

### I'm a... 
...~~Felinism Preacher~~ multifaceted ~~Tech-Priest~~ developer, I started my studies in Visual Arts (High-School), to "run away" from Math (and because I was good enough), after which I wanted to run away from papers and pencils ðŸ˜¹, so I entered in the Multimidia Bachelor Degree (EsACT-IPB) with my interest in Post-Production and Editing, however it was presented to me "programming" in my first year with "Introduction to Programming" which I loved (really unexpected), and during that period I took extra classes from others degrees since Game Development till Android with Java (my least favorite field), in December 2023 I concluded my Informatics Master Degree (ESTiG-IPB) with my [ thesis related with the use of XR and Machine Learning to improve Healthcare](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/377110487_The_Use_of_Extended_Reality_and_Machine_Learning_to_Improve_Healthcare_and_Promote_GreenHealth). Currently I'm a PhD Student at UTAD since September 2024.

I like and im always open to experiment different technologies and programming fields, while I don't consider myself expert in none of them in terms of experience or deep knowledge, I like to know "where" to start if needed.
